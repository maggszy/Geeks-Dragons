This strategic game of ancient warfare allows the player, with a unique new solitaire system, to try an accomplish a lasting peace. All existing solitaire systems on the market have the player take one side for the entire game. Unfortunately this pits the player against a random system with poor strategic direction. In Peloponnesian War you get to play both sides, pitting yourself against the best you can offer. If the game system is winning, the player is forced to continue with the losing side. Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory. In this manner the player competes against himself in the classic tradition of the Greek tragedy.&#10;&#10;",boardgame,56.99

6,Dragonwood,2015.0,20.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Dare to enter Dragonwood! Deep in the heart of this mythical forest lurk angry ogres, giggling goblins, and even the famed and fearsome fire-breathers themselves!&#10;&#10;In Dragonwood, you collect sets of adventurer cards to earn dice, which you then use to roll against your foes. Stomp on some fire ants, scream at a grumpy troll, or strike the menacing orange dragon with a magical silver sword. Choose your strategy carefully because the landscape of Dragonwood is ever-changing. Only the bravest will overcome the odds to emerge victorious!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;On their turn, players either draw a card or attempt to capture a creature or enhancement.  Players draw from the Adventurer deck that contains cards of 5 different colors all numbered 1-12.  With these cards players form combinations to attempt a Strike (cards in a row of any color), a Stomp (cards of the same number) or a Scream (cards of the same color). To capture, players roll a number of dice equal to the number of cards they have of the particular combination. Each creature has different minimum values of a Strike, Stomp or Scream needed to capture it, and a Victory Point amount.&#10;  &#10;The game includes six, six-sided dice with sides 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 4 to reduce extremely lucky outcomes.  The Dragonwood deck has 42 cards, 5 of which are displayed in the landscape at any time.  In addition to creatures, this deck also has enhancements that are captured in the same way as creatures which assist players in capturing creatures, and contains events that also impact play.  When both dragons have been defeated, the game is over and the player with the most victory points wins!&#10;  &#10;Is the best strategy to go for several smaller creatures or save up for larger attacks?  Should you grab some enhancements hoping they will pay off, or go immediately for creatures?  Do you take chances on some rolls or go for sure things?  Every time you play Dragonwood the deck is different, so no two games are the same!&#10;&#10;",boardgame,79.99

It comes with a new board, 46 new destination cards and a set of rules (in several languages) to create a new game. The Ticket to Ride: Switzerland map and rules first appeared as an exclusive map for the Ticket to Ride computer game. In addition to being specifically designed for a smaller numbers of players the map has several new features. Locomotive cards are used exclusively for tunnels (which work as they do in Ticket to Ride: Europe). Some destination cards have an end point inside Switzerland and other possible ends in adjacent countries (the value of the completed card is based on the farthest possible connection completed). There are also destination cards for connections between adjacent countries.&#10;&#10;Although not officially sanctioned, it works fine with Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries also. Due to Ticket to Ride: M&#195;&#164;rklin's different distribution of train cards, Ticket to Ride: Switzerland is not considered to be compatible.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented / Re-printed in:&#10;&#10;    Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; India & Switzerland&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",boardgameexpansion,104.99

9,Unspeakable Words (Deluxe Edition),2015.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,8.0,"Unspeakable Words is the Call of Cthulhu Word Game designed by James Ernest and Mike Selinker. In the game, you and your opponents will attempt to form words from the letter cards in your hand. Each letter is worth points &ndash; the amount of points is determined by the number of angles in the letter (where the hounds of Tindalos are lurking!). You may try to make the highest scoring word possible, but&hellip; you&rsquo;ll have to test the strength of the word against a roll of the 20-sided die. Roll equal to or higher than the value of your word and you&rsquo;re safe&hellip; but roll less than the value of your word and you lose a precious piece of your sanity, represented by an adorable Cthulhu pawn!&#10;&#10;Each letter is uniquely illustrated with a horrifying character from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, which adds to the dark whimsy of the game.&#10;&#10;Since its release in 2007, Unspeakable Words has been received with great reviews. It was Games Magazine's Word Game of the Year and the Best Party Board Game at BoardGameGeek's Golden Geek Awards.  In 2008, a second edition of Unspeakable Words was released, this time with purple pawns. Because of the flexibility of the game, a second deck and second set of pawns can be added for twice as many players.&#10;&#10;Since the inception of Unspeakable Words, Playroom Entertainment has wanted to release more specialized editions. With this Kickstarter, supporters can upgrade the Unspeakable Words game with special multi-colored pawns (five pawns each of eight colors to play up to eight players!), a dice/pawn bag and additional cards! AND...this Deluxe Edition will feature artwork by famed artist John Kovalic! Plus, if we hit our stretch goals, even more amazing things will be added to the game!&#10;&#10;",boardgame,188.99

Each round, reveal a topic card from the deck; the color of the card on the top of the deck reveals which topic is chosen for the round. Each player then draws three images as quickly as possible, with the round ending as soon as the next-to-last player has finished his drawings.&#10;&#10;Everyone then compares their images to see who's drawn what. Real artists score one point for each image they drew that no one else drew, while fakes score one point for each image drawn by at least one real artist (and zero points for everything else). After the role cards have circled the table once, the game ends and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",boardgame,139.99

If an incorrect guess is made, all other players take one card from the table (or from the draw deck if there are not enough cards showing).

Indian players get to select one or two of their active tribes, but the rest are dealt to them randomly. There are usually more Indian tribes available than what are active each turn, but players don't really know which ones are inactive.  This can be unsettling to the U.S. player as he must decide where to deploy his limited troops and columns.&#10;&#10;All players compete to earn victory points.  The U.S. player is faced with the task of building up sufficient resources (settlements, towns, railroads, mines, etc.) to maintain existing states and convert territories into states. The Indian players play the role of guerrillas to earn victory points, but also can deny resources to the U.S. player. However, he must be very careful not to suffer too many casualties, as this could cause his tribe to go on reservation or become extinct, which costs the player dearly in victory points.&#10;&#10;",boardgame,92.99

The singers are represented by old fashioned 45s, with a disc in the center showing values from 5 to 12. Each time a singer is transferred from control of one player to another, the disc is rotated, so the value can rise to 12, but next move, it drops to 5 again. You try to gain control of an artist at high value, or pass artists from one player to another to make them devalue. Scoring occurs when players choose to put on concerts at the end of their turn, including a gala show which doubles the value. The game rules state that the designers produced this game by phone and fax, without ever meeting.

34,1805: Sea of Glory,2009.0,480.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,"Spring, 1805&#10;Napoleon&rsquo;s Grande Armee&rsquo; is encamped along the shores of the English Channel. Following the teachings of Alexander, the French Emperor seeks to defeat a naval power from the land. He has but to place his 200,000 troops on British soil and France&rsquo;s hereditary enemy will finally fall. To do this, his combined fleet must control the Channel long enough for hundreds of shallow draft boats to ferry his troops to England. Standing in the Emperor&rsquo;s way is the Royal Navy.&#10;&#10;The year 1805, which is punctuated by the British naval victory at Trafalgar, represents one of England&rsquo;s darkest times during the Napoleonic Wars. Her great &ldquo;wooden walls&rdquo; offer the island nation its only defense against a far superior foe.&#10;&#10;1805: Sea of Glory examines the naval war on an operational level during that pivotal year. Although Trafalgar shines through history as the beacon of victory, it is the successful blockade of enemy ports that kept French boats from stepping onto British soil. But 1805: Sea of Glory is more than just a game about blockade duty. It is a game of breakout and pursuit, deception and false leads, husbanding meager resources, striking a blow where your enemy least suspects, and bringing about the decisive battle that defines victory or defeat.&#10;&#10;1805: Sea of Glory focuses on the operational actions of the three great navies. The Allied player (France &amp; Spain) must constantly try to break out of numerous European ports and form a combined fleet. The British player must continuously worry about his ships on station, as wind and weather allow the enemy an opening to slip anchor and set sail. For when Napoleon&rsquo;s fleets take flight, the British are hard pressed to cover all the potential targets and bring the enemy to bear. The British player will find that he never has enough frigates to watch all avenues of escape, and that a clever French player can keep him guessing and ultimately win this game of cat and mouse.&#10;&#10;The game uses blocks to represent the fog of war. The ability to spot and intercept your enemy is paramount. But is that block scurrying across the Mediterranean towards Egypt the French fleet? Or has the Toulon squadron turned west towards the Caribbean? From the French perspective, is the block off the coast of Brest a fleet? Or have the British returned home to repair and refit, leaving only a few frigates to watch the port? Is now the moment to sortie? Or does a large enemy force lay just over the horizon?&#10;&#10;While blocks represent fleets, squadrons, and scouting frigates, traditional counters represent the individual ships of the line. Every ship that could have seen duty, from lowly 64 gunners to the massive Santissima Trinidad, is present. Individual ships are kept on off map organizational charts, so that the exact composition of a fleet or squadron block is not known to your opponent until interception takes place.&#10;&#10;The great naval commanders of the age are present in the game as well. Rosily-Mesros, Villeneuve, Ganteaume, Missiessy, and Gravina for the Allied fleets. Cornwallis, Nelson, Calder, Collingwood, and Strachan for the British. Each admiral is rated for his ability to escape or pursue, as well as, his tactical acumen in combat. Special abilities are also included: from Cornwallis&rsquo; skill as an administrator, to Villeneuve&rsquo;s fatalistic bent, to Gravina&rsquo;s charisma, to Nelson&rsquo;s visionary brilliance brought to life as the &ldquo;Nelson Touch&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map covers the North Atlantic from the Channel Coast to Africa, and the Mediterranean from the Straits of Gibraltar to Egyptian shores. An insert map covers the West Indies. Each hex represents 50 nautical miles. An Atlantic transit track handles fleets and squadrons sailing from Europe to the Caribbean and back. The major ports of the three belligerents are shown; each rated for harbor facilities and their effect on a fleet&rsquo;s ability to sortie.&#10;&#10;Weather also plays a huge part in the game. Storms and squalls will blow blockading forces off station, allowing the Allied player the opportunity to escape. While at sea, fleets and squadrons are at the mercy of the wind. True to any age of sail game, fleets may become becalmed at the worst possible moment. Prevailing winds are also noted on the map, resulting in interesting strategic options. A player that learns to anticipate and utilize the game&rsquo;s weather system will have the advantage. Beware being caught at sea in the Windward or Leeward Islands during hurricane season.&#10;&#10;Each individual ship is rated for its firepower and morale. The Allied player will cringe as his Spanish ships strike their colors early in a battle, while the steadfast Jack Tars of the Royal Navy will never seem to falter. But despite their superiority at sea, the British are not invincible, and a shrewd French player will find ways to thwart his enemy. Fire high and disable the British so that you can slip away, or stand hull to hull and exchange broadsides?&#10;&#10;A unique tactical combat system rewards fleets that seize the weather gauge. Each player has a selection of tactics chits which represent flag signals sent to his ships during battle. Choose the right combination of maneuver and sail settings to break the enemy line. Take the leeward position and attempt to escape before the windward fleet can close. Or from the leeward, turn and fight, creating a gauntlet of fire an overly aggressive enemy must endure. A Trafalgar sized battle can be fought out in less than 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;Although the game ends immediately in a French victory if the Allied fleet ever controls the English Channel, there is also a set of variable victory conditions. The British Admiralty must watch out for French invasions of Egypt, Malta, Naples, Ireland, or West Indies islands. The British player will quickly learn that he never has enough ships to cover every potential threat.&#10;&#10;A series of random events rounds out the simulation. Napoleon&rsquo;s meddling, British manpower shortages, West Indies fever, Spanish drafts, favorable winds, and Royalist spies are among some of the events that will hinder or help players achieve victory.&#10;&#10;",boardgame,53.99
